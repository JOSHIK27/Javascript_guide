// inheritance is accessing properties of parent by child
// an object has self contained piece of code in itself (methods, data)
// each object we create is linked to an object called prototype and prototype object has its own prototype and so on
//

const obj = {
  a: 1,
};

obj.__proto__ = {
  b: 2,
};

// this is how we set prototype of an object ( this prototype object has its own prototype )
// whenever we try to access a value it checks in itself and then moves to prototype object.....continues till null

// MDN Example

const o = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  // __proto__ sets the [[Prototype]]. It's specified here
  // as another object literal.
  __proto__: {
    b: 3,
    c: 4,
  },
};

// o.[[Prototype]] has properties b and c.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype (we will explain
// what that means later).
// Finally, o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null.
// This is the end of the prototype chain, as null,
// by definition, has no [[Prototype]].
// Thus, the full prototype chain looks like:
// { a: 1, b: 2 } ---> { b: 3, c: 4 } ---> Object.prototype ---> null

console.log(o.a); // 1
// Is there an 'a' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 1.

console.log(o.b); // 2
// Is there a 'b' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 2.
// The prototype also has a 'b' property, but it's not visited.
// This is called Property Shadowing

console.log(o.c); // 4
// Is there a 'c' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'c' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? Yes, its value is 4.

console.log(o.d); // undefined
// Is there a 'd' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'd' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? No, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype and
// there is no 'd' property by default, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null, stop searching,
// no property found, return undefined.

// inheritance of methods

const parent = {
  value: 2,
  method() {
    return this.value + 1;
  },
};

console.log(parent.method()); // 3
// When calling parent.method in this case, 'this' refers to parent

// child is an object that inherits from parent
const child = {
  __proto__: parent,
};
console.log(child.method()); // 3
// When child.method is called, 'this' refers to child.
// So when child inherits the method of parent,
// The property 'value' is sought on child. However, since child
// doesn't have an own property called 'value', the property is
// found on the [[Prototype]], which is parent.value.

child.value = 4; // assign the value 4 to the property 'value' on child.
// This shadows the 'value' property on parent.
// The child object now looks like:
// { value: 4, __proto__: { value: 2, method: [Function] } }
console.log(child.method()); // 5
// Since child now has the 'value' property, 'this.value' means
// child.value instead

// A constructor function
function Box(value) {
  this.value = value;
}

// Properties all boxes created from the Box() constructor
// will have
Box.prototype.getValue = function () {
  return this.value;
};

const boxes = [new Box(1), new Box(2), new Box(3)];

class Box {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  // Methods are created on Box.prototype
  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}
