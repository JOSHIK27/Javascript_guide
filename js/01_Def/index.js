// Javascript is scripting language
// It is high level language (there's a maximum abstraction)
// It is dyamically typed language (we do not have to specify data type while creating variables)
// It is single threaded, synchronous language ( single call stack, sequential execution -> blocks all below lines while executing current line )
// It is loosely typed language ( a variable can be overriden with different data type )
// Javascript follows ecmascript standard rules & guidelines (there are several other scripting languages which follow ecmascript standards. For eg: JScript -> Microsoft explorer)
